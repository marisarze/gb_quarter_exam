# This repository contains a solution to the problem of sorting an array of strings of 3 or less characters in length.

## The task is algorithmically not the most difficult, however, to fully complete the test work it is necessary:

1. Create a repository on GitHub
2. Draw a flowchart of the algorithm (you can get by with a flowchart of the main content if you separate it into a separate method)
3. Provide the repository with a formalized text description of the solution (README.md file)
4. Write a program that solves the problem
5. Use version control when working on this small project (it shouldnâ€™t be that everything is covered in one commit, at least stages 2, 3, and 4 should be located in different commits)


## A brief block diagram of the solution is presented in the image

## To run this program you need to do:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/marisarze/gb_quarter_exam.git
cd gb_quarter_exam
dotnet run console
~~~
